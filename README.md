# User-Directory (React)

This is an API employee directory using React. I broke my application UI into components, using component state, and responses to user events.

## Description of my Project:

### Homework-14

This is a custom API employee directory. I used a table component to display my API responses. Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. The user is able to view each profile by:

1. First Name
2. Last Name
3. City
4. State
5. Email
6. Age
7. Gender
8. Phone Number
9. Cell Number
10. Picture

## Installation Instructions:

1. type npm install
2. view the file by typing npm start

## Usage Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context:

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
